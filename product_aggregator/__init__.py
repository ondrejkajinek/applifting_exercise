"""
Product aggregator is a demonstration of my Python skills.

It was requested on Friday, 3rd July 2020, by Anna Marie Rybáčková. I suppose
she wanted to make me happy or give me some opportunity to get a better job.
If she thought I'd be happy, she might actually be right. But she was NOT.
Instead of finishing my sword belt, I have to code during weekend!
I hope to have an opportunity to severely thank her for a chance to leave
my current job.
